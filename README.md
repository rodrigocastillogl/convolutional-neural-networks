# Convolution Neural Networks

When dealing with tabular data (rows corresponding to observations and columns to features)
we anticipate that patterns, that we hope our deep learing model to learn, involve interactions
among features. However we do not assume any structure concerning how the features interact.
In these cases, a MLP is good idea.

But when our data are images (usually this involves very large input data) we can take advantage
of the fact that they exhibit rich structure that can be exploited using
*Convolutional Neural Networks*.
